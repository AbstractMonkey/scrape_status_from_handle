Scrape statuses from a given Twitter handle
# scrape_status_from_handle

In order to run this, you need the Twitter API for Python and a Twitter dev account. Once you have those, fill in these fields in the source code:

    	twitter_consumer_key = ''
    	twitter_consumer_secret = ''
    	twitter_access_token = ''
    	twitter_access_secret = ''

And change the Twitter handle in the code from @Github to any handle of your choosing.

Scraping the text from Twitter statuses has a variety of applications. Analytics can be run on the text to determine personality type and interests of the Twitter user. This information can then be used to make decisions, like whether to advertise to this type of user.
